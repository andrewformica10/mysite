        <h1>5 Things to Know About Rattlesnakes and Their Babies</h1>
        <p>UA College of Pharmacy | Aug. 6, 2014</p>

        <p>Arguably, snake season is year-round in Arizona, a state
            known for its rattlers. But baby rattlesnakes are born in July and August,
            making these two months especially dangerous for hikers, gardeners, children
            and others at high risk of exposure to rattlesnake bites.</p>
        <img src="SnakeBite.jpg" alt="Snake bite on side of child's foot">
        <p>So far this year, 74 rattlesnake bites to humans have been reported to the
            Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center. Based at the University of
            Arizona College of Pharmacy, the center serves the entire state of
            Arizona with the exception of Maricopa County, providing free and
            confidential poison and medication information to callers around the
            clock.</p>
        <p>Specialists answering the phones at the center regularly receive calls
            from Arizonans of all ages who don't realize they were bitten by a rattler.
            The poison center urges anyone who feels a mysterious sting, pinch or
            bite while outdoors to immediately call the center at 800-222-1222.</p>
        <p>"We will ask a few questions that will help you either identify possible
            snakebite or eliminate it," said Keith Boesen, director of the Arizona
            Poison and Drug Information Center. "With snakebite, the sooner the
            medical treatment, the better the outcome, so calling us right away can
            make a very big difference for the victims and the medical teams treating
            them."</p>
        <p>The center advises anyone who might come cross paths with rattlesnakes
            to be aware of these five things:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Baby rattlesnakes range in length from 6 to 12 inches and are easily
                camouflaged by brush and grass.</li>
            <li>Baby rattlesnakes are rattleless until they first shed their skins, so there
                will be no infamous "chica-chica" sound before they strike.</li>
            <li>Despite their impish size, baby snakes have enough venom to be very
                dangerous if they bite a human.</li>
            <li>Adult rattlesnakes do not always rattle an audible warning before or
                while they are biting.</li>
            <li>It's a good idea to call the poison center if you notice an unidentified
                small cut or wound, even if you feel no pain. With the lack of telltale
                rattle warning, people can be bitten without knowing what has happened
                until they notice their symptoms and attribute them to a snakebite.</li>
        </ol>
